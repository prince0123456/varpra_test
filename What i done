In this code, we have a todos state variable that holds an array of todo items, each of which is an object with a text property for the todo text and a timestamp property for the time the todo was added.

The handleInputChange function updates the inputValue state variable as the user types into the input field. The handleAddTodo function adds a new todo item to the todos array with the current timestamp (using Date.now()) and clears the input field.

The formatTimeDiff function is the same as in the previous example and formats the time difference between the current time and the given timestamp.

In the return statement, we have the UI for the app, which includes an input field and a "Add Todo" button for adding new todos, as well as a <ul> element for displaying the list of todos. We use the map method to iterate over the todos array and render a <li> element for each todo item. The todo text is displayed in a <span> element with the todo-text class, and the timestamp is displayed in a <span> element with the todo-timestamp class.
We use the formatTimeDiff function to format the timestamp for display.
